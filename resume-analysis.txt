-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flow Step       	Phase       	             Core Action


1. INPUT    	    Data Ingestion	            Uploads resume and Job Description text.(Frontend Frameworks-React, File Handling Libraries (PyPDF2, python-docx))


2. PARSING	        Extraction & Structuring	Convert unstructured text into a machine-readable(OCR-for image PDFs, NLP/AI Libraries (spaCy, NLTK), Resume Parsing API)


3. JD ANALYSIS	    Requirement Definition	    Extract all mandatory and preferred criteria from job description (NLP/LLMs, JSON (for outputting defined criteria))


4. MATCHING	        Data Comparison	            Compare structured resume data against structured JD criteria (Python/Backend Logic-Custom functions for Boolean and numeric checks, Skill Taxonomies, Simple SQL)


5. SCORING	        Weighted Calculation	    Compute final compatibility score by weighting skill, experience, and salary alignment(scikit-learn-for statistical matching/similarity calculation like TF-IDF, Python Logic-Applying weighted coefficients and summing scores)


6. SALARY CHECK	    Financial Filter	        Compare the candidate's salary requirement against the company's budget range (Simple Conditional Logic JSON)


7. OUTPUT	        Final Assessment	        Present the score and final verdict (Strong/Normal/Weak) to the recruiter/user.	Frontend/UI (Displaying the percentage score and categorical label); API/Database (Recording the score for ranking).
